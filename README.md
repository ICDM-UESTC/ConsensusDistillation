## 🧩 Overview

<p align="center">

</p>

TL;DR: Our ICML paper proposed Explanation Ensemble (EE), which improves the trustworthiness of SI-GNNs by aggregating multiple explanations from independently trained models. While effective, it has high computational cost during inference (limits its deployment) and is incompatible with single-explanation metrics such as FID (limits its evaluation). In this extension, we propose Consensus Distillation (CD), which distills the ensemble’s consensus knowledge into a single model, retaining EE’s capability while addressing its limitations.

## ⚙️ Installation

We recommend creating a fresh Python environment (e.g., with conda):

```bash
conda create -n exgnn python=3.9
conda activate exgnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📚 Datasets

We evaluate our method on a variety of datasets:

* Synthetic: BA-2MOTIFS
* Molecular: MUTAGENICITY, 3MR, BENZENE

Datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RaOKbWABerHfea_sJZGIbXSy0FcOzK0O?usp=sharing), place all datasets (e.g., `ba_2motifs`, `benzene`, `mr`, `mutag`) in the `datasets/` folder.

---

## 🏃‍♀️ Quick Start

### 1. Train self-interpretable GNNs 

```bash
python main.py --run_time 10 --dataset ba_2motifs --method gsat_cd
```


### 2. Evaluate redundancy (SHD and AUC)

```bash
python main.py --run_time 10 --dataset ba_2motifs --method gsat_cd --calculate_all_metrics
```

---

## 📁 Pretrained Checkpoints
We provide **pretrained model checkpoints** for quick evaluation and reproduction.  

You can download them from the [Releases](https://github.com/ICDM-UESTC/ConsensusDistillation/releases) tab

To use the checkpoint, place it in the `outputs/checkpoints/` folder and run:
```bash
python main.py --run_time 10 --dataset ba_2motifs --method gsat_cd --calculate_all_metrics
```
